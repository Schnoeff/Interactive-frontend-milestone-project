Seaside Retreats

My interactive project is a website designed to help users/customers easily search for and book hotels at a wide variety of british seaside locations. My website is a very simple and easy to use site consisting of a homepage, a dropdown list of 5 locations the user can access, a gallery page which has the most popular locations the site has to offer and a contact page which has a fully functioning contact form which will be sent to my gmail instantly with a template highlighting the users name, email and their enquiry. The site also includes a vast amount of functions and features for the user to utilise how they see fit such as the google maps api located on the home page which has a marker set for each location which when hovered will display an info box which has a brief summary of that location. 

For my websites design I decided to use a combination of light and dark blues throughout the page to follow the general sea/water look which is usually assosiated with the beach theme. Each title and header is in bigger and bolder text to highlight each section out clearly with standard black text which I felt contrasted best on the backgrounds and provided the professional look is was trying to portray. I also decided that on every page I added a 1px thick black border around each section of content creating a clearer structure to the page making it easier to follow and understand.

UX

This website is targeted towards the 40+ age group as from what I understand, it is typically the older people to enjoy going away to the beach for long weekends in luxuary hotels as most of those locations are tailored towards the older generation. I have tried to design my pages in such a way to draw that older age group in with it's simple, accessible and bright style through the use of the layout and features. The goal of this site is to allow users to navigate around the site and find their perfect weekend holiday situated by the beachfront all over the UK and book a holiday with their specific specifications of date and price. If they get stuck at all then they will be able to utilise the contact form to get in touch with someone who can help thm further. 

User stories

An old couple would like to book a hotel in Cornwall which is pet friendly and close to the beach which is slightly more luxuary than any other hotels that they would have seen or heard of before. All they would need to do in order to find and book a hotel which fits those requirements is click on the locations dropdown and click on Cornwall. From there they would need to simply scroll down the page to find all the hotel on offer which include 5 images on a carousel and clearly highlighted feature lists accompanied by icons. 

Another story is that a young couple would like to book a hotel by the seaside but they are unsure on how where they need to park and they are also unsure about what attractions are near to the hotel they have chosen. In order to solve this issue they would just need to click on the contact us button located on the nav bar and fill in the form with their name, email address and what they question is. Then an operator would see the email then reply to the enqiry with the provided email address and the couple would then know what they need to know.

Features

Google maps api - I used the google maps api on the index.html page and added 5 infowindow markers. Allows the user to see nearby locations by clicking on the markers.

Social media links - This allows the user to click on any of the social media icons located in the footer of the page. Doing so will have them redirected to another tab where they will arrive at that social media page.

PDF button - Allows the user to download the brochure on the index.html page. Doing so willopen a new tab with the PDF file.

Image carousel - Allows the user to view 5 images per hotel by clicking on the slider buttons. This gives the user a greater insight to the hotel.
